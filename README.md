# Anime Tracker

This is my final project for Per Scholas. I wanted to create an APP that utilizes the Jikan API that pulls info from MyAnimeList, specifically I wanted to create a website that shows the currently airing anime so that it would be easier to figure out what's currently airing and when I can expect new episodes to come out. I implemented features such as saving anime to a personal account library and rating saved anime.
